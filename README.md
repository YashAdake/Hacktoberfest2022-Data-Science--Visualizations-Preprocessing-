# Hacktoberfest2022-Data-Science--Visualizations-Preprocessing-

- ***The Dataset is available in the master branch!***
- ***Create your own file for visualisations/preprocessing and then add it to the respective language folder in the master branch.***
- ***If the folder for your language is not available then please create the folder and add your file. (In master branch only!)***

## CONTEXT:
This is a dataset of electric vehicles.

One of the more popular data science datasets is the mtcars dataset. It is known for its simplicity when running analysis and visualizations.

When looking for simple datasets on EVs, there don't seem to be any. Also, given the growth in this market, this is something many would be curious about. Hence, the reason for creating this dataset.

## TASKS:
Some basic tasks would include

- Which car has the fastest 0-100 acceleration?
- Which has the highest efficiency?
- Does a difference in power train effect the range, top speed, efficiency?
- Which manufacturer has the most number of vehicles?
- How does price relate to rapid charging?

## CONTENT:
We have included two datasets below:

'ElectricCarData_Clean.csv'
-- original pulled data.

'ElectricCarData_Norm.csv'
-- units removed from each of the rows
-- rapid charge has a binary yes/no value

The point of both is to have users practice some data visualizations and cleaning.
